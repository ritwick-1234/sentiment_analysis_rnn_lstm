# Sentiment analysis,IMDB movie reviews
In this sentiment analysis project,  IMDB dataset is used to train a model designed to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The IMDB dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis tasks, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.
First  tried a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN) for the sentiment analysis task and achieved an accuracy of 50 % only.Using RNN and Embeddings accuracy is coming 52% . After evaluating the performance of the SimpleRNN model,  decided to enhance the model by using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with an embedding layer and achieved an accuracy score of 82 %. Deployed the LSTM model, which provides more accurate and nuanced sentiment predictions compared to the simpler RNN model.
