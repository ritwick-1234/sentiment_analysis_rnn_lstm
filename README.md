# Sentiment analysis,IMDB movie reviews
In this sentiment analysis project, I used the IMDb dataset to train a model designed to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The IMDb dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis tasks, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.
Initially, I tried a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN) for the sentiment analysis task and achieved an accuracy of 50 % only.After evaluating the performance of the SimpleRNN model, I decided to enhance the model by using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with an embedding layer and achieved an accuracy score of 82 %.I deployed the LSTM model, which provided more accurate and nuanced sentiment predictions compared to the simpler RNN model.
